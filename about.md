## Pacfic Northwest National Scenic Trail Map Viewer
This project aims to create a space to explore the Pacific Northwest Trail, its features, and the context that it exists within. It is built on top of Jekyll's Minima theme and uses a custom map layout. It was made for a directed studies project at UBC (GEOS 448) under the advisement of Luke Bergmann
